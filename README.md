# MZ-Studios
Official website of MZ Studios game dev.

This project is oficial website of my little company named "MZ Studios".
I made it because I wanted to try on "Stopka Framework", which I work on. It's very simple framework, which didn't saw optimalization and real speed. Connecting PHP with
really slow thing make n2 slow project.
I also tried to add Bootstrap to this site to make it look better. I'm not good at it so don't cry about resposive and look of it.
I want to make other project named "Stopka Framework", which would be more popular than Symfony one day. I hope so!
